* text=auto eol=lf
*: This is typically a wildcard character that can represent any text or file. In this context, it likely indicates that the directive should be applied to all subsequent text or files.
text=auto: This part specifies the text encoding. "auto" means that the encoding should be automatically detected based on the file's content. This is useful when working with files of unknown encoding.
eol=lf: This part specifies the end-of-line character sequence. "lf" stands for "line feed" (LF), which is a single character used to indicate the end of a line in Unix-like systems.
Overall, the command * text=auto eol=lf means:

Automatically detect the text encoding: The encoding of the text will be determined based on its content.
Use line feed (LF) as the end-of-line character: The end of each line in the text will be marked with a single LF character.
